subject = "Abuse contact cannot be filled by analyzer"

<p>Hi,</p>

<p><strong>
    The SCART analyzer cannot find (on ownername, abuse email or, if registrar, on maindomain) WhoIs information for url: {{ url }}.
</strong></p>

<p>
    Action is needed. The url can manual be connected to an existing abusecontact. Or a new abusecontact can manual be added in SCART and the url can be connected to this one.
</p>
