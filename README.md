##Goals and what we do

Our goal is to provide resources that help to combat internet abuse. We will try to achieve this by:

* Create Open Source Software (OSS) and tools based on Open Standards to help manage and detect abuse and help users to resolve internet abuse. This software must be easily installable and for anyone to use, from end users to large network operators or ISPâ€™s
* Represent the interests of the abuse community
* Provide Education on combating internet abuse and promote the usage of resources to combat internet abuse.
